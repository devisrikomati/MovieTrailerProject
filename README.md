# MovieTrailerProject
#This project is for people  who are intrested to watching movie trailers.
#I have taken three python files named as entertainment_center.py,fresh_tomatoes.py,media.py.
#I created a folder and in this created another folder named as cgi-bin.
#These three python files put in a cgi-bin folder
#In entertainment_center.py there is a function named Movie() which includes the parameters movie_title, movie_poster link and movie_trailer link.
#when we run the entertainment_center.py it generate html file with the name of fresh_tomatoes.html is created outside the cgi-bin folder.
#To close the movie trailer click on close button(X) or click on the page.
